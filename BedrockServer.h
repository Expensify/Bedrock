    // Shutting Down and Standing Down a BedrockServer.
    //
    // # What's the difference between these two things?
    //
    // Shutting down is pretty obvious - when we want to turn a server off, we shut it down. The shut down process
    // tries to do this without interrupting any client requests.
    // Standing down is a little less obvious. If we're the leader node in a cluster, there are two ways to stand down.
    // The first is that we are shutting down, in which case we'll need to let the rest of the cluster know that it
    // will need to pick a new leader. The other is if a higher-priority leader asks to stand up in our place. In this
    // second case, we'll stand down without shutting down.
    //
    //
    // # Shutting Down
    // Let's start with shutting down. Standing down is a subset of shutting down (when we start out leading), and
    // we'll get to that later.
    //
    // When a BedrockServer comes up, it's _shutdownState is RUNNING. This is the normal operational state. When the
    // server receives a signal, that state changes to START_SHUTDOWN. This change causes a couple things to happen:
    //
    // 1. The command port is closed, and no new connections are accepted from clients.
    // 2. When we respond to commands, we add a `Connection: close` header to them, and close the socket after the
    //    response is sent.
    // 3. We set timeouts for any HTTPS commands to five seconds. Note that if we are following, this has no effect on
    //    commands that were escalated to leader, we continue waiting for those commands.
    //
    // The server then continues operating as normal until there are no client connections left (because we've stopped
    // accepting them, and closed any connections as we responded to their commands), at which point it switches to
    // CLIENTS_RESPONDED. The sync node notices this, and on it's next update() loop, it begins shutting down. If it
    // was leading, the first thing it does in this case is switch to STANDINGDOWN. See more on standing down in the
    // next section.
    //
    // The sync node will continue STANDINGDOWN until two conditions are true:
    //
    // 1. There are no commands in progress.
    // 2. There are no outstanding queued commands.
    //
    // A "command in progress" is essentially any command that we have not completed but is not in our main command
    // queue. We increment the count of these commands when we dequeue a command from the main queue, and decrememnt it
    // when we respond to the command (and also in a few other exception cases where the command is abandoned or does
    // not require a response). This means that if a command has been moved to the queue of outstanding HTTPS commands,
    // or the sync thread queue, or is currently being handled by a worker, or escalated to leader, it's "in progress".
    //
    // If we were not leading, there is no STANDINGDOWN state to wait through - all of a followers commands come from
    // local clients, and once those connections are all closed, then that means every command has been responded to,
    // implying that there are neither queued commands nor commands in progress.
    //
    // The sync node then finishes standing down, informing the other nodes in the cluster that it is now in the
    // SEARCHING state. At this point, we switch to the DONE state. The sync thread waits for worker threads to join.
    // The worker threads, when they find the main command queue empty, will check for the DONE state, and return. The
    // sync thread can then complete and the server is shut down.
    //
    //
    // # Standing Down
    // Standing down when shutting down is covered in the above section, but there's an additional bit of work to do of
    // we're standing down without shutting down. The main difference is that we are not waiting on all existing
    // clients to be disconnected while we stand down - we will be able to service these same clients as a follower as
    // soon as we finish this operation. However, we still have the same criteria for STANDINGDOWN as listed above, no
    // commands in progress, and an empty command queue.
    //
    // When a node switches to STANDINGDOWN, it starts rejecting escalated commands from peers. This allows it to run
    // through its current list of pending escalated commands and finish them all (this is true whether we're shutting
    // down or not, and it's why shutting down is able to complete the entire queue of commands without it potentially
    // adding new commands that keep it from ever emptying). However, this doesn't keep new commands that arrive
    // locally from being added to main queue. This could potentially keep us from ever finishing the queue. So, when
    // we are in a STANDINGDOWN state, any new commands from local clients are inserted into a temporary
    // `_standDownQueue` instead of the main queue. As soon as STANDINGDOWN completes, these commands will be moved
    // back to the main queue.
    //
    // The reason we have to wait for the main queue to be empty *and* no commands to be in progress when standing
    // down, is because of the way certain commands can move between queues. For instance, a command that has a pending
    // HTTPS transaction is "in progress" until the transaction completes, but then re-queued for processing by a
    // worker thread. If we allowed commands to remain in the main queue while standing down, some of them could be
    // HTTPS commands with completed requests. If these didn't get processed until after the node finished standing
    // down, then we'd try and run processCommand() while following, which would be invalid. For this reason, we need to
    // make sure any command that has ever been started gets completed before we finish standing down. Unfortunately,
    // once a command has been added to the main queue, there's no way of knowing whether it's ever been started
    // without inspecting every command in the queue, hence the `_standDownQueue`.
    //
    // NOTE: in both cases of shutting down or standing down, we discard any commands in the main queue that are
    // scheduled to happen more than 5 seconds in the future. In the case that we're shutting down, there's nothing we
    // can do about these, except not shut down. If we're standing down, we could keep them, but they break our
    // checking against whether the main command queue is empty, and fall into the same category of us being unable to
    // distinguish them from commands that may have already started.
    //
    // Notes on timing out a shutdown.
    // Here's how timing out a shutdown works:
    // 1. When _beginShutdown() is called, it sets a one minute timer. It proceeds to shut down the node as normal.
    // 2. When shutdown progresses far enough that we can shut down the sync node, we set the timeout for the sync node
    // to whatever portion of our minute is remaining (minus 5 seconds, to allow for final cleanup afterward - also, we
    // make sure this value stays positive, so will always be at least 1us).
    // 3. The sync node should finish with at least 5 seconds left, and we should finish any final cleanup or responses
    // and shut down cleanly.
    //
    // However, if we do get to the end of our 1 minute timer, everything just starts exiting. Worker threads return,
    // whether there's more work to do or not. The sync thread drops out of it's main loop and starts joining workers.
    // This leaves us in a potentially broken state, and hitting the timeout should count as an error condition, but we
    // need to support it for now. Here's the case that should look catastrophic, but is actually quite common, and what
    // we should eventually do about it:
    //
    // A follower begins shutdown, and sets a 60 second timeout. It has escalated commands to leader. It wants to wait for
    // the responses to these commands before it finishes shutting down, but *there is no timeout on escalated
    // commands*. Normally, we won't try to shut down the sync node until we've responded to all connected clients.
    // Because there will always be connected clients waiting for these responses to escalated commands, we'll wait the
    // full 60 seconds, and then we'll just die with no responses. Effectively, the sever `kill -9`'s itself here,
    // leaving clients hanging with no cleanup.
    //
    // On leader, this state could be catastrophic, though leader doesn't need to worry about a lack of timeouts on
    // escalations, so let's look at a different case - a command running a custom query that takes longer than our 60
    // second timeout. There will be a local client waiting for the response to this command, so the same criteria
    // breaks - we can't shut down the sync thread until it's complete, but the command it's waiting for doesn't return
    // until after our timeout. This is *after* everything just starts exiting, which is to say the sync node could
    // have shut down due to hitting the timeout before a worker thread shut down performing a write command. This
    // write will be orphaned, as the sync node will not be able to send it out, and this database is then forked.
    //
    // We can't safely start shutting down the sync node until we know that all possible writes are complete for this
    // reason, but if we're going to enforce a timeout, then we need to.
    //
    // The only way to make this timeout safe is to make sure no individual command can live longer than our shutdown
    // timeout, which would require time-stamping commands pre-escalation and giving up on them if we failed to receive
    // a response in time, as well as making sure that commands always return in less time than that (they currently,
    // usually will, as long as the default command timeout is less than one minute, but they can still block in system
    // calls like sleep(), and the timeout is configurable). Certainly, no "normal" command (i.e., a programmatically
    // generated command, as opposed to something like a CustomQuery command) should have a timeout longer than the
    // shutdown timeout, or it can cause a non-graceful shutdown.
    //
    // Of course, if nothing can take longer than the shutdown timeout, then we should never hit that timeout, and all
    // our failures should be limited to individual commands rather than the entire server shutting down.
