// A scheduled priority queue does the following:
// Enqueues items with a scheduled time, a priority, and a timeout.
// Both the scheduled time and timeout are epoch times in microseconds.
//
// Once queued, a caller can call "get" to retrieve the next item in the queue.
//
// What counts as the next item:
//
// If any item has timed out, it is the timed out item (if multiple items have timed out, it is the one with the oldest
// timeout timestamp. If multiple items have identical timeout timestamps, which if those items is returned is
// unspecified).
//
// If no items have timed out, the items are returned in order of priority, but only if they're scheduled before now.
//
// I.e., if two items are scheduled at the same timestamp, and that timestamp is before now, the one with the higher
// priority is returned.
//
// If two items have the same priority, the one with the older scheduled timestamp is returned.
//
// Items scheduled in the future are never returned (unless they've timed out).
