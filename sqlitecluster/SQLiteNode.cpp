// Introduction
// ------------
// SQLiteNode builds atop STCPNode and SQLite to provide a distributed transactional SQL database. The STCPNode base
// class establishes and maintains connections with all peers: if any connection fails, it forever attempts to
// re-establish. This frees the SQLiteNode layer to focus on the high-level distributed database state machine.
//
// FIXME: Handle the case where two nodes have conflicting databases. Should find where they fork, tag the affected
//        accounts for manual review, and adopt the higher-priority
//
// FIXME: Leader should detect whether any followers fall out of sync for any reason, identify/tag affected accounts, and
//        re-synchronize.
//
// FIXME: Add test to measure how long it takes for leader to stabilize.
//
// FIXME: If leader dies before sending ESCALATE_RESPONSE (or if follower dies before receiving it), then a command might
//        have been committed to the database without notifying whoever initiated it. Perhaps have the caller identify
//        each command with a unique command id, and verify inside the query that the command hasn't been executed yet?

// *** DOCUMENTATION OF MESSAGE FIELDS ***
// Note: Yes, two of these fields start with lowercase chars.
// CommitCount:      The highest committed transaction ID in the DB currently. This can be higher than any transaction
//                   currently being handled. This exists to answer the question "how much data does this peer have?"
//                   and not to communicate any information about a specific transaction in progress.
// Hash:             The hash corresponding to the value in CommitCount.
// ID:               The ID of the transaction currently being operated on. It is the same type of information as
//                   "CommitCount", but not necessarily for the most recent transaction in the DB. It can be prefixed
//                   with "ASYNC_" for asynchronous transactions.
// NewHash:          Hash, but for "ID" instead of "CommitCount".
//                   Proposal: rename to "currentTransactionHash".
// NewCount:         Same as "ID" except without the "ASYNC_" prefix.
// State:            The state of the peer sending the message (i.e., SEARCHING, LEADING).
// Version:          The version string of the node sending the message.
// Permafollower:    Boolean value (string "true" or "false") indicating if the node sending the message is a
//                   permafollower.
// Priority:         The priority of the node. 0 for permafollowers.
// StateChangeCount: The number of state changes that this node has performed since startup. This is useful because
//                   it's sent at STANDINGUP, and parroted back by followers with an "approve" or "deny". This allows
//                   the leader to confirm that these responses were in fact sent in response to the correct message,
//                   and not some old out-of-date message from the past.
// Response:         Sent in STANDUP_RESPONSE, either "approve" or "deny".
// NumCommits:       With a "SYNCHRONIZE_RESPONSE" message, indicates the number of commits returned.
// leaderSendTime:   Timestamp in microseconds that leader sent a message, for performance analysis.
// dbCountAtStart:   The highest committed transaction in the DB at the start of this transaction on leader, for
//                   optimizing replication.

// State Machine
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Here is a simplified state diagram showing the major state transitions:
//
//                              SEARCHING
//                                  |
//                            SYNCHRONIZING
//                                  |
//                               WAITING
//                    ___________/     \____________
//                   |                              |
//              STANDINGUP                     SUBSCRIBING
//                   |                              |
//                LEADING                       FOLLOWING
//                   |                              |
//             STANDINGDOWN                         |
//                   |___________       ____________|
//                               \     /
//                              SEARCHING
//
// In short, every node starts out in the SEARCHING state, where it simply tries
// to establish all its peer connections.  Once done, each node SYNCHRONIZES with
// the freshest peer, meaning they download whatever "commits" they are
// missing.  Then they WAIT until the highest priority node "stands up" to become
// the new "leader".  All other nodes then SUBSCRIBE and become "followers".  If the
// leader "stands down", then all followers unsubscribe and everybody goes back into
// the SEARCHING state and tries it all over again.
//
//
// State Transitions
// -----------------
// Each state transitions according to the following events and operates as follows:
bool SQLiteNode::update() {

    // Log network timing info.
    auto now = chrono::steady_clock::now();
    if (now > (_lastNetStatTime + 10s)) {
