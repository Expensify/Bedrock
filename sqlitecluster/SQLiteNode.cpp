/// Introduction
/// ------------
/// SQLiteNode builds atop STCPNode and SQLite to provide a distributed
/// transactional SQL database.  The STCPNode base class establishes and maintains
/// connections with all peers: if any connection fails, it forever attempts to
/// re-establish.  This frees the SQLiteNode layer to focus on the high-level
/// distributed database state machine.
///
/// **FIXME**: Assertion in WAITING for no currentMaster is sometimes false;
///          appears to block the STANDUP
///
/// **FIXME**: Handle the case where two nodes have conflicting databases;
///          should find where they fork, tag the affected accounts for manual
///          review, and adopt the higher-priority
///
/// **FIXME**: Master should detect whether any slaves fall out of sync for any
///          reason, identify/tag affected accounts, and resynchronize.
///
/// **FIXME**: Add test to measure how long it takes for master to stabalize
///
/// **FIXME**: Add 'nextActivity' to update() [TYLER: Partially addressed?]
///
/// **FIXME**: If master dies before sending ESCALATE_RESPONSE (or if slave dies
///            before receiving it), then a command might have been committed to
///            the database without notifying whoever initiated it.  Perhaps have
///            the caller identify each command with a unique command guid, and
///            verify inside the query that the command hasn't been executed yet?
