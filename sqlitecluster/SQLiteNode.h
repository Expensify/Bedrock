// This file is long and complex. For each nested sub-structure (I.e., classes inside classes) we have attempted to
// arrange things as such:
// For each public/private block:
// 1. classes/structs/type definitions
// 2. static members
// 3. static methods
// 4. const methods
// 5. non-const methods
// 6. const instance members
// 7. non-const instance members.
// 8. In each of these sections, things should be alphabetized.

/*
 * Rules for maintaining SQLiteNode methods so that atomicity works as intended.
 *
 * No non-const members should be publicly exposed.
 * Any public method that is `const` must shared_lock<>(nodeMutex).
 * Alternatively, a public `const` method that is a simple getter for an atomic property can skip the lock.
 * Any public method that is non-const must unique_lock<>(nodeMutex) before changing any internal state, and must hold
 * this lock until it is done changing state to make this method's changes atomic.
 * Any private methods must not call public methods.
 * Any private methods must not lock nodeMutex (for recursion reasons).
 * Any public methods must not call other public methods.
 *
 * `_replicate` is a special exception because it runs in multiple threads internally. It needs to handle locking if it
 * changes any internal state (and it calls `changeState`, which does).
 *
