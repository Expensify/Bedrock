  // This is a little bit weird so let me explain. We have, and long have had, a publicly visible member
  // `const SData request`. This is const because it prevents all sort of weird reply bugs that happen when commands
  // get re-run due to database conflicts. This works great *except* that it was discovered that this breaks move
  // semantics. Because the request object was const, it could not be moved-from. Instead, in places where the move
  // constructor was called, it would be copied, which could be quite expensive for large requests.
  // The solution was to add a private, non-const request variable that can be moved-from, and to make the existing
  // `request` object a const reference to this internal object. This allows the move constructor to move-from the
  // existing object's privateRequest, and then initialize `request` to refer to it.
