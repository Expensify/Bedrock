/* This test is inherently a non-conclusive test. It aims to submit conflicting HTTPS requests, but there's no simple
 * way to prove, conclusively that any of our commands actually conflicted. This test is constructed such that it has
 * a very high likelihood of causing a conflict (and in practice, seems to cause 8-10 on each run), but it's possible
 * that there were no conflicts, in which case the test succeeds but does not perform its main function, which is:
 *
 * What we really want to do here is validate that when a command with a HTTPS request conflicts, we retry processing
 * it without re-sending the HTTPS request. This is handled in testplugin's `sendrequest` command, where we'll
 * specifically aim to detect multiple instances of calling `peek` on this request, and throw an exception if we get to
 * process having done so more than once. There are also places in SQLiteNode that should assert on this condition.
 *
 * However, to actually verify that you saw a conflict during the test, you can look at the logs for something like:
 *
 * Feb 22 00:32:16 vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64 bedrock: brcluster_node_0 (SQLiteNode.cpp:1298) update [sync] [warn] 
 *     {brcluster_node_0/LEADING} ROLLBACK, conflicted on sync: brcluster_node_0#109 : sendrequest
