/* This class currently tests two important cases for fast stand down, 1 that we can stand down with commands currently running (the HTTPS test does this)
 * And 2, that we can stand down with commands queued (the future commands test does this).
 * It does not exhaustively test every case because they're almost impossible to test, largely for timing reasons.
 *
 * Some cases that would be nice to test:
 * * Commands in the blocking commit queue.
 * * Commands in the middle of running `process()`.
 * * Commands where the node state change in the call to `commit()`.
 *
 * Unfortunately these are very hard to do, and the expectation is that these cases work very similarly to the cases we DO have tests for.
